    "# 🎶 Concert Enjoyment Classification – Data Exploration and Base Models\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to predict a concertgoer’s overall experience by classifying each concert experience into one of four categories: **Worst Concert Ever**, **Did Not Enjoy**, **Enjoyed**, and **Best Concert Ever**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction is based on information describing the performing band, the venue, concert conditions, and individual concertgoer characteristics. By combining these heterogeneous features, the objective is to estimate how a specific person will experience a specific concert.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction & Problem Definition\n",
    "The target variable in this project represents increasing levels of concert enjoyment and therefore has a **natural ordering**. Treating the labels as independent classes would ignore the relative distance between outcomes, even though predicting a nearby category is less severe than predicting an extreme one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the task is framed as an **ordinal classification problem**. The goal is to learn a model that not only predicts the correct class, but also respects the ordered structure of concert enjoyment levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the dataset, applies preprocessing and feature engineering, evaluates baseline classifiers, and investigates ordinal-aware models designed to better capture the structure of the problem."

    "### 📊 Dataset Description\n",
    "The dataset contains information describing concert experiences, combining characteristics of the band, the concert, and the concertgoer. Each row represents a single concert experience, defined as a specific concert attended by a specific concertgoer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same bands, concerts, and concertgoers appear consistently across both the training and test sets. As a result, patterns learned from these entities in the training data are expected to generalize to the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to imperfections in the data-gathering process, some features may not perfectly reflect real-world values. However, the target variable Concert Enjoyment has been verified and is considered fully reliable.\n",

The categorical Enjoyment is well ranked and meaningful and should be taken into consideration i.e. if a Band had a high percentage of \"Best Concert Ever\" ranking, the \"Enjoyed\" ranking will also be high while the \"Did not Enjoy\" ranking will be low with \"Worst concert Ever\" being the lowest.

    "Ordinal Ridge regression was chosen as the base model because the target variable is ordinal and the dataset is high-dimensional, with many features that are likely noisy or weakly informative on their own. The model treats concert enjoyment as a continuous latent score and applies L2 regularization, which helps stabilize learning and prevents overfitting in this setting. Mord’s Ordinal Ridge builds directly on scikit-learn’s Ridge Regression, making it both efficient and reliable, while naturally respecting the ordering between classes. Given its strong generalization performance and compatibility with ordinal evaluation metrics, it provides a solid and well-justified baseline for this task."

    "- The Mord Ordinal Ridge classifier provides a reasonable baseline for predicting concert enjoyment and is able to capture the ordinal structure of the target variable.\n",
    "- However, its performance remains limited, with only marginal improvements observed through hyperparameter tuning, suggesting that a linear ordinal formulation may not be sufficient to fully capture the complexity of the data.\n",
    "- Although L2 regularization mitigates issues related to multicollinearity, the presence of many correlated and potentially noisy features may require models with greater expressive power.\n",
    "- As a result, more flexible ordinal models are explored to assess whether they can better model non-linear relationships and improve predictive performance."
